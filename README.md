   With the increasing demand of disposable cups usage at all NTUâ€™s major events, a lot of voices are raised to combat the high consumption of energy and the emission of greenhouse gases released during the manufacturing processes. The most common reason is people are too lazy to bring their own cups everyday to school.On the other hand, there are a lot of left-over food from school canteens and restaurants everyday, while there are a lot of poors and needy outside who desperately need some food to survive.

   Our group proposes a set of solutions to tackle each of the problems stated above. Firstly, we will have a cup/plate vending machine to replace the single-use cup/plate. Patrons are allowed to use our service without paying a single penny. Rewards will also be given to patrons who constantly support us.

   Next, we will have a platform for food vendors/caterers to track and predict their daily sales. Our algorithm will help vendors to optimize and predict how much food should they prepare everyday to reduce food wastage. Vendors can also donate extra food to the needy through our platform.
